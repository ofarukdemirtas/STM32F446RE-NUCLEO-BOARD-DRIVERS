# STM32F446RE Nucleo Board Drivers

## Description
This repository contains drivers for the STM32F446RE Nucleo board, providing an interface to various peripherals and functionalities of the microcontroller. It aims to simplify the development process for embedded applications using STM32F446RE.

## Features
- GPIO control
- UART communication
- I2C and SPI interfaces
- Timer management
- ADC functionality

## Installation

To get started with the STM32F446RE Nucleo board drivers, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ofarukdemirtas/STM32F446RE-NUCLEO-BOARD-DRIVERS.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
